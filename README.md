# Train-Time
Homework 07

## About this Project
This is an app to store and calculate train schedules based on user-submitted train information. The page will load the trains from Firebase that have been submitted during past sessions. The user can add a new train by submitting the required information. The app will calculate the next arrival time and minutes remaining until that train arrives.

This app is fully mobile responsive because it is made with Bootstrap.
